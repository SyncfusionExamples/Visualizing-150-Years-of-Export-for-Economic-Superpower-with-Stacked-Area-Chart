# Visualizing 100+ years of Exports for Top Economic Superpower with Annotations
This article shows how to create the .NET MAUI stacked area chart to visualize 150 years of exports for the top economic superpower with annotations.

[Annotations](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/annotation) are essential for enhancing the visual appeal and informational depth of charts. They allow you to add additional elements, such as shapes, text, or even custom views, to highlight specific areas of interest and provide context to the data. Here’s a closer look at the three main types of annotations: ShapeAnnotation, ViewAnnotation, and TextAnnotation.

  1.[ShapeAnnotation](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/annotation#shape-annotation) allows you to add shapes such as rectangles, circles, lines to your charts. These shapes can highlight specific data points, emphasize trends, or delineate areas of interest. ShapeAnnotation enhances the overall aesthetics of your visualizations while making them more informative and engaging for viewers.

  2.[ViewAnnotation](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/annotation#view-annotation) enables the embedding of custom views directly onto the chart canvas. These views can be images, buttons, or any other interactive element, enhancing the chart’s interactivity and functionality. ViewAnnotation enhances the chart's capability to provide dynamic data insights and improves user engagement by offering customized visual enhancements tailored to specific data visualization needs.

  3.[TextAnnotation](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/annotation#text-annotation) allows you to add text labels or notes directly onto the chart. This feature is particularly useful for providing context, labeling data points, or explaining trends.

A stacked area chart is a type of data visualization that displays multiple series of data stacked on top of one another to show how each part contributes to the whole over time or categories. It is particularly effective for illustrating cumulative totals and understanding trends in data distribution across different segments. Stacked area charts provide a clear visual representation of the relative proportions of each category or series within the dataset, making it easier to compare changes and patterns over time or across categories.
